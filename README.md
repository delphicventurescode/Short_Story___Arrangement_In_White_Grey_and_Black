-- Arrangement in White, Grey and Black Number 2

As he rolled over in the middle of the night, he felt the need to pee. Not wanting to leave the comfort of his warm bed on a cold night, he tried to fight the urge, hoping he would fall asleep again. His bladder won the battle of wits in a few minutes. It always does. "This is why you should stop your stupid habit of taking a huge gulp of water just before hitting the bed", he chided himself as he walked over lazily to the restroom.

His eyes still closed, he fumbled his way to the commode in the dark, sat down and started doing his business. (He didn't want to do it standing up, risking missing the target in the dark). A few seconds in, he felt something crawl on his feet. Having the presence of mind not to yell and wake up his wife, he reached out quickly and switched on the light. It was a cockroach. A reasonably big one, one that could fly. 'Damn it', he cursed. Ever since they started the construction work a couple of months ago, they had removed the insect screen on all his windows and the balcony door. He had been seeing a lot of creepy-crawlies enter the home since then.

The intruder identified, he sat back down on the commode to empty the rest of his bladder as he pondered the question of dealing with it. So began a conversation between himself, and, well, himself, as he talked himself through the solution to his new-found midnight problem.

"Should I kill it or find a way to relocate it outside the house without harm?" he asked himself.
`Even if I do the latter, with the windows and doors being open all day, it's going to find its way back` reasoned his second half.

"Okay, I will kill it. With one strike. The cockroach shouldn't suffer. One moment it is alive, the next moment, it is dead: the kindest death I could give it"
`Good`

"What should I kill it with?" was the next question that popped up.

A newspaper, a shoe, a broomstick were the weapons that presented themselves.

`All of them are going to make a loud noise.`

"What if I trap it first by throwing a cloth on it? I can then carry it near the door far from the bedroom and finish it off there".

`Yes, but how are you going to ensure it will be one strike, without first locating it under the cloth?`

"I will have to hit it multiple times to ensure its death"

`You call that a quick, suffering-free death?`, rebuked his second half.

"What if I throw the cloth, isolate the cockroach under it and pick it up so I know exactly where it is. I only need one strike then.", beamed his first half, convinced he had found a satisfactory solution.
`And how about the suffering it will endure as you carry it all the way to the other end of the house, trapped under the cloth?`

His second half was excelling at playing devil's advocate. I will call the cockroach Irene he said.

He was still half asleep. He remembered, for really no reason at all, that Jacobin Magazine had written that Paul Krugman was wrong about Medicare For All (https://www.jacobinmag.com/…/medicare-for-all-america-plan-…). And the answer came to him in a flash as to why Krugman was right. All that graduate school education must have done his brain some good. Krugman is never wrong. Never! Never, ever. Never, ever, ever. And so is Brad DeLong on Healthcare Reform. They are both right again, he knew.

And then, he thought sadly about how the Healthcare Debate had been going on for decades now. He remembered that quote by Harry Truman about healthcare Reform. Back from the forties. Every word of it -- in terms of the importance of why having healthcare for everyone is a good idea - still rang true. Another issue like that is gun control, he thought. Why no gun control reform yet?

At this point in the conversation between he, himself and Irene, the cockroach, the insect in one quick motion, crawled under the cabinet, out of sight.

`"Well, that takes care of that"` both his halves said in unison.

"There goes tonight's sleep", he thought as he got up. He knew very well his brain was fully active and far from sleep now.
He washed his hands and headed over to the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee and start his day early. 5 hours early. But the bullshit debate on Gun Control had already started on CNN. Five minutes too late. Darn it!

And so he switched to a different channel from his flat in Manali. And he told himself: "These are all America's problems, not mine."
